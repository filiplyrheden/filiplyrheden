# Hi! 👋

## 🤠 About me
Fullstack web developer student with a background in journalism — combining storytelling, design sense, and technical skills to create engaging and user-friendly digital experiences.

📢 **Currently looking for a full-stack web development internship starting November 2025.**

💻 What I enjoy most about development is problem solving and using coding to find creative solutions. I really like the logical and structured approach to work that coding gives you.

🎨 I also have a great interest in design, typography and user interfaces. 

🍲 📖 🏃‍♂️ 🎮 When I'm not coding I enjoy cooking, reading, exercise and video games.
