# Hi! 👋

## 🤠 About me
I'm a web developer currently studying the full stack web developer program at Yrgo in Gothenburg, Sweden. 

💻 What I enjoy most about development is problem solving and using coding to find creative solutions. I really like the logical and structured approach to work that coding gives you.

🎨 I also have a great interest in design, typography and user interfaces. 

📰 In my previous work life I worked as a journalist, which gave me a great appreciation for good storytelling and presenting information to users in a nicely packaged and easy to understand way.

🍲 📖 🏃‍♂️ 🎮 When I'm not coding I enjoy cooking, reading, running and video games.
